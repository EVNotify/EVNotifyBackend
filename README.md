### Contributing
Feel free to contribute and report issues or suggestions.
If you are a developer and want to contribute, have a look at the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

The App of EVNotify as well as the Backend has an integrated mechanism to track errors with a tool called Rollbar. This allows faster tracking of uncaught errors.

For API Analytics and error tracking a tool called Moesif is used.
